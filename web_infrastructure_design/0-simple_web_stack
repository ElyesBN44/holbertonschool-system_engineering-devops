One Server Web Infrastructure
Goal: Design a web infrastructure using 1 server to host www.foobar.com.

üìå Diagram Summary (for whiteboard):
User ‚Üí www.foobar.com
        |
        v
  DNS Record (A: 8.8.8.8)
        |
        v
     [Server]
    - Nginx (Web Server)
    - App Server
    - App Code
    - MySQL DB
üßæ Key Concepts:
Server: Physical or virtual machine providing services.

Domain Name: Maps a name (foobar.com) to server IP.

DNS Record: www is a CNAME or A record pointing to 8.8.8.8.

Web Server (Nginx): Handles HTTP requests.

App Server: Processes logic and serves content.

Database (MySQL): Stores and retrieves data.

Communication: User ‚Üî HTTPS (via Nginx)

‚ö†Ô∏è Issues:
SPOF: One server; if it fails, the site goes down.

No scaling: Can‚Äôt handle high traffic.

Maintenance downtime: Restarting web server disrupts users.
