Distributed Web Infrastructure
Goal: Use 3 servers for scalability with HAProxy, Nginx, MySQL.

üßæ Key Concepts:
Load Balancer (HAProxy): Distributes traffic.

Algorithm: Round-robin (even traffic sharing).

Setup: Active-Active (both servers handle traffic).

Primary-Replica DB:

Primary (writes), Replica (reads only).

Replication = automatic sync from primary to replica.

Application View: Connects to primary for writes, replica for reads.

‚ö†Ô∏è Issues:
SPOF: HAProxy is a single point of failure.

Security: No firewalls, no HTTPS.

No Monitoring: Can‚Äôt detect failures or load.
