Secured and Monitored Infrastructure
Goal: Extend the distributed setup with security and monitoring.

üßæ Key Concepts:
Firewalls (3): Block unauthorized access.

SSL (HTTPS): Encrypts all web traffic.

Monitoring Agents: Collect metrics, logs (QPS, CPU).

Tool: Sumologic, Prometheus, etc.

Use: Detect traffic spikes, errors.

üìä Monitor Web QPS:
Monitor Nginx logs or expose metrics via Prometheus.

‚ö†Ô∏è Issues:
SSL Termination at LB: Internal traffic not encrypted.

Single DB Write Node: If primary fails, write operations break.

All-in-One Servers: Web/App/DB on same servers can cause resource contention and poor scaling.
